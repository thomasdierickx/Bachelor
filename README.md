# Bachelor Project
There are 2 sides to this project
-	Catalogue
-	AR Application

## Catalogue
In this part the catalogue is a very important feature. Not only is this simply just a book with text and images but a showcase of every product that is made by Samsonite themselves. Now for people like me, you go through this book once, look at everything and close it and that's it. How can this be made more intractable or more experience full? It has to come to life!

### Come to life
The idea behind this part is basically that images turn to videos and transitions. Like in Harry Potter movies. Only, in this project, it's with cases. The app recognises certain images and replaces them with videos that support the Ibon etc.

##AR Application
The AR app is another big feature. Not only does it work with every surrounding but it makes the Ibon case itself come to life. But the case is digitally visualised in the environment you are in! The user also has the opportunity to move the case to certain tables, closets and what not to fit it in. The app has several pre-loaded models for you to walk to, test and see if the case fits!

## How do they do it?
Probably the most important description. The app is made in Swift Arkit. With some external libraries like MBProgressHud for messages, etc.
